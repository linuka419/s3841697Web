		Cartography consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). While there were two tests and a first practical (not included as it was more of a report rather than a map), the significant
		practicals completed in Cartography 2 involved the production of three maps of the student's choice based on a specific topic:
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Practical 2: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data of Melbourne City</li>
			<li>Practical 3: Thematic mapping of a demographic's population using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
			<li>Final Cartography Map: Free-choice on topic</li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->

		Cadastral Law is a unique but very practical and interesting unit solely based about surveying in the Cadastral world. The subject uses 
		knowledge from three different disciplines:
		<ul>
			<li>General law</li>
			<li>Urban Surveys</li>
			<li>Rural Surveys</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		<p>
			The Urban Survey completed at Parkville the primary objective is to define, mark, and document property boundaries for land ownership and Re-Establishment, often in highly developed and densely populated street
			in Parkville We were then asked to use the fieldnotes created on the practical day to draw up an articulate worksheet with traverse adjustment and Re-Establishment along with all aspects.

		Reflecting on my experience as an Assistant Surveyor, I find that it has been an enriching journey that has significantly shaped both my professional skills 
		and personal growth. When I first joined Humphries Land Surveying, I was eager to apply the theoretical knowledge I had gained during my studies, but I quickly 
		realized that the field of surveying demands much more than just technical expertise. On a personal level, this experience has reinforced the importance of patience
		and perseverance. Surveying can be a repetitive and time-consuming process, but I’ve come to appreciate the value of patience in ensuring that every detail is 
		captured accurately. Moreover, the experience has taught me to be adaptable and open to continuous learning, as each project presents unique challenges that require 
		innovative solutions.

		My time at my current surveying company, I realize how much I have grown both professionally and personally. Joining the team at Linear Land Surveying felt 
		like a significant step forward in my career, and now, after gaining substantial experience, I can see the impact this role has had on my development. 
		This job has taught me resilience and the importance of continuous learning. The dynamic nature of surveying projects means that no two days are the same, 
		and I’ve had to remain adaptable and open to new challenges. I’ve also learned the value of patience and persistence qualities that are essential when facing
		the inevitable obstacles that arise in the field. This experience has made me more confident in my abilities and more comfortable with uncertainty and change.
		<p>
			Through these various work experiences, I was able to acquire various skills such as:
			-	Strong leadership abilities, acquired through training new employees
			-	Communication skills developed through constantly interacting with customers and co-workers
			-	Organisational abilities enhanced through completing key tasks and responsibilities within a given time  
			-	Ability to comply to company procedures and managers instructions by ensuring that health and safety standards were always maintained
